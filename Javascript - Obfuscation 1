Another time, we can check in source tab the ch4.html
Into script tag we can see pass : "pass = '%63%70%61%73%62%69%65%6e%64%75%72%70%61%73%73%77%6f%72%64';"

We can see this condition : 
              
              "if(h == unescape(pass)) {
                  alert('Password accept√©, vous pouvez valider le challenge avec ce mot de passe.\nYou an validate the challenge using this pass.');
              } else {
                  alert('Mauvais mot de passe / wrong password');
              }"
             
Thats how we know which password we have to use

We can use the console browser and use the function unescape with the pass in order to see it.

If you don't know how to use console or what is it, you can use this website : https://www.urldecoder.org/
