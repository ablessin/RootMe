Another time, we can check in source tab the ch12.html

Into script tag we can see : 
  var pass = unescape("unescape%28%22String.fromCharCode%2528104%252C68%252C117%252C102%252C106%252C100%252C107%252C105%252C49%252C53%252C54%2529%22%29");

We can use the console browser and use the function unescape with the pass in order to see it.

After doing it, we can see another string to unescape, doing it again

At this point, we can use the String.fromCharCode function still in console or use website in order to decrypt it
